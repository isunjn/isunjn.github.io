Hi, This is my personal cyber hut where I write random words (mostly in zh-cn).

I'm building a career as a software engineer and currently work at a startup.
Currently I'm focusing on front-end development, but I'm also interested in other areas of software engineering.

In my spare time, I work on my side projects and contribute to open-source code.
Outside of coding, I enjoy running, reading and playing video games. I like Jazz HipHop and am a cat person.

Have a nice day!
