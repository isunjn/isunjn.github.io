Hi! This is my personal cyber hut where I write random words (mostly in zh-cn).

About me: I'm pursuing a career as a software engineer and am currently working at a startup. In my spare time, I work on my side projects and contribute to open-source code. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading books, watching anime and movie, going outside for a walk, ride, or run, and playing video games. Also I'm a cat person.

Have a nice day!
